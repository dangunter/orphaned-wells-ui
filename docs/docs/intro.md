# Introduction to OGRRE

## About

The **O**il and **G**as **R**egulatory **R**ecord Digitiz**e**r, or OGGRE, was created as part of
the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Consortium Advancing Technology for Assessment of Lost Oil & Gas Wells (CATALOG),
a collaborative effort between NETL, LANL, SNL, and LLNL.

The co-oauthors of the OGGRE software are:
Dan Gunter (LBNL), Michael Pesce (LBNL), Rajshree Deshmukh (LBNL), Mumbi Mundia-Howe (NETL), Jacob Shay (NETL), Nathan D. Webb (ISGS), Chester J. Weiss (SNL), David Buttler (LLNL), Daniel Oâ€™Malley (LANL)

## Motivation
Details describing the construction and use history of all wells in the U.S. are missing from most public and proprietary well databases.
Most well information is not digital.
This hinders well plugging planning, understanding historic practices, and well characterization efforts.

To address these challenges, the OGGRE tool is a user-friendly platform that allows users to leverage OCR and LLM models
for rapid data extraction from records.

## Using OGRRE

Currently, OGRRE is being used in tandem with close collaboration with the joint LBNL and NETL team.
For those working with this team already, please see this [guide](guide).
